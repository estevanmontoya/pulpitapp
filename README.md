## A web application to create sermon outlines, access them anywhere, and preach your heart out.

My name is [Pastor Estevan Montoya}(http://www.estevanmontoya.com), of the [Mountain View Baptist Church](http://www.MVBCTaos.org) in Taos, NM.

God has given me the ability to make things for churches and to help God's men in their local church.

This web application is a simple note taking system for preachers to create sermon outlines online, and access them on any device to help them preach. After years of using outline notebooks, and LOSING notebooks, I decided to create a place to keep track of sermons.

 I pray God uses this application to enable preachers freedom to preach in the power of God.
